## boringssl-build

To avoid the need for various AntelopeIO projects which use BoringSSL to depend on Go, this repo contains the generated build files from BoringSSL's prescribed [INCORPORATING.md](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/HEAD/INCORPORATING.md) created via `generate_build_files.py cmake`.
