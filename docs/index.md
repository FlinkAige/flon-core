FullOn is the next-generation blockchain platform for creating and deploying smart contracts and distributed applications. FullOn comes with a number of programs. The primary ones included in FullOn are the following:

* [funod](01_funod/index.md) - Core service daemon that runs a node for block production, API endpoints, or local development.
* [fucli](02_cleos/index.md) - Command line interface to interact with the blockchain (via `funod`) and manage wallets (via `fuwal`).
* [fuwal](03_keosd/index.md) - Component that manages FullOn keys in wallets and provides a secure enclave for digital signing.

The basic relationship between these components is illustrated in the diagram below.
